# DeepStack Trainer
[DeepStack](https://deepstack.cc/) is an AI server that empowers every developer in the world to easily build state-of-the-art AI systems both on premise and in the cloud. The promises of Artificial Intelligence are huge but becoming a machine learning engineer is hard. DeepStack is device and language agnostic. You can run it on Windows, Mac OS, Linux, Raspberry PI and use it with any programming language.

DeepStackâ€™s source code is available on GitHub via [https://github.com/johnolafenwa/DeepStack](https://github.com/johnolafenwa/DeepStack/)

[DeepStack Trainer](https://github.com/t0mer/deepstack-trainer) is a [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.co) powerd web application that helps us train and test Deepstack AI easelly as possible.

## Features
- Face Registring.
- Test face recognition.
- Test scene recognition.
- Test object detection.
- Gallery page, display all uploaded images (For traning only).

## Components used in Deepstack Trainer
- [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) - For running web server
- [materializecss](https://materializecss.com/) - For web forms
- [sweetalert2](https://sweetalert2.github.io/) - For alerts and messages

# Installation
#### Deepstack Installation
In order to use Deepstack Trainer we need to install Deepstack.
We can do that by running the following command:

```docker run -e VISION-FACE=True -v localstorage:/datastore -p 80:5000 deepquestai/deepstack```

Basic Parameters:
* -e VISION-FACE=True This enables the face recognition APIs.
* -v localstorage:/datastore This specifies the local volume where deepstack will store all data.
* -p 80:5000 This makes deepstack accessible via port 80 of the machine.

We can also install Deepstack using docker-compose:
```
version: "3.7"
services:
  deepstack:
    image: deepquestai/deepstack:latest
    restart: unless-stopped
    container_name: deepstack
    ports:
      - "80:5000"
    environment:
      - TZ=Asia/Jerusalem
      - VISION-FACE=True
      - VISION-DETECTION=True
      - VISION-SCENE=True
    volumes:
      - ./deepstack:/datastore
```

#### Deepstack Trainer Installation
Deepstack Trainer installation is very easy using docker-compose:
```
version: "3.7"
services:
  deepstack_trainer:
    image: techblog/deepstack-trainer
    container_name: deepstack_trainer
    privileged: true
    restart: always
    environment:
      - DEEPSTACK_HOST_ADDRESS=
      - DEEPSTACK_API_KEY=
      - MIN_CONFIDANCE=
    ports:
      - "8080:8080" 
    volumes:
      - ./deepstack-trainer/db:/opt/trainer/db #Database storing the uploaded photos data (Filename, Person name, Date).
      - ./deepstack-trainer/uploads:/opt/trainer/photos/uploads #Phisical path for storing the images
      
```

Basic Parameters:
* DEEPSTACK_HOST_ADDRESS - Deepstack API Url (http://localhost:5000)
* DEEPSTACK_API_KEY - If your Deepstack API is token protected enter your token here or alse leave blank
* MIN_CONFIDANCE - Minimum Confidence level to identify object or face (Default is 0.70)
